NOTE: This base code is not my own work and I take no credit for it. Please follow the links provided for great tutorials on how to do 2d 
game design. I simply used there base code rather than recreate a whole character controller and movement from scratch. This way I could 
work only on adding animations and learning how to use the animator and state machines in Unity. All assets are found on the Unity asset 
store.
